This is a google map and a few tables which show online and offline merchants that accept bitcoin as a payment method in Bulgaria.

The app uses:
- React;
- ReactJSS for styling;
- Data extraction from Google Sheets;
- Google Map with Markers and InfoWindows;
- Internationalization with i18next.

The app is then built and integrated into a WordPress blogpost at https://btcpay.bg/map/ . The app is everything between the header and the comments section.
